        Welcome to my website! I am a first year sutdent here at the Illinois Institute of Technologly, studyng Information Technologly an Managenment. I am from Kankakee Illinois, a small town just south of chicago... So I'm basically a chicagoan even though a true chicagoan would see right though me. I am a newbie when it comes to coding. My first expirences with coding were in my first semester of college with Java. I am currently enrolled in a Python course, as well as Html. I am really enjoying web design.
